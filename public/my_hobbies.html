        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me on the football pitch. Whether it's a friendly kickabout with friends or
            a competitive <br> match, football is my go-to way to de-stress, challenge myself physically, and enjoy the
            camaraderie of teamwork.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I dive into the world of eFootball, putting my strategic thinking and virtual football
            skills to the test. <br> Building my dream team and outsmarting opponents online keeps the competitive

        <p>Recharging for me often involves kicking back with friends. <br> Whether it's catching a movie, grabbing coffee,
            or just hanging out, these relaxed moments of laughter and conversation are essential.<br> There's something
            about simply chilling with good company that unwinds me and keeps the fun in life.</p>

            <h3>solo Travelling</h3>
        </li>
        <img src="../images/travel.jpeg" alt="travelling">
        <p>My wanderlust is best satisfied through solo travel. Exploring new cities, immersing myself in different
            cultures, and forging my own path are incredibly rewarding.<br> From bustling markets to peaceful mountain
            hikes, I relish the freedom and self-discovery that solo adventures bring.</p>
